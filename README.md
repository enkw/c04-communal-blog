# c04-communal-blog

## Description

This project is a demonstration of what I've learned about Web-APIs during my recent time with the NW bootcamp.
I was able to use this as great practice for js, and was even able to utilize some even more recent things I've learned with jQuery.

CSS continues to be a bit of a struggle for me, but I'm developing a deeper understanding of how to get things to do what I want,
though more practice is needed.

## Usage

Loading the page will bring you to the main page of the blog which prompts the user for a username, subject, and content.

Failing to fill out all fields will prompt the user to try again, and once the user is able to post, they will be redirected to a page that will display their post as a card.

From here the user is able to go back and submit additional posts, or they are able to view my portfolio via the link at the bottom of the page.

Both the home page and the blog page have a toggle switch for dark mode if the user desires such.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![Screenshot of the homepage's blog post area](assets/images/screenshot.png)
![Screenshot of the blog page showing a post with subject, content, and username listed](assets/images/screenshot.png)
![Screenshot of the dark mode toggle](assets/images/screenshot.png)
![Screenshot of the blog post area with dark mode activated](assets/images/screenshot.png)

## Features

This application allows the user to post to this as you would using a blog. Dark mode functionality has been added as well after reading more than I'd care to admit about how to implement it lol.
