## Description

This project is a demonstration of what I've learned about Web-APIs during my recent time with the NW bootcamp.
I was able to use this as great practice for js, and was even able to utilize some even more recent things I've learned with jQuery.

CSS continues to be a bit of a struggle for me, but I'm developing a deeper understanding of how to get things to do what I want,
though more practice is needed.
